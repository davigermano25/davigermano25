Hi I'm Davi, and I'm from Palhoça SC

My main job is to be a Network Analyst where I help to implement network and security/acess control solutions. It's my family company, so I'm glad to help and collaborate to grow the company;

My big love is electronic music, so I listen to it everyday, usually go to parties. I'm actually playing as dj and learning to produce music as well;

Me and my girlfriend bought an apartment, and it have been very energy consuming, to keep it organized and clean;
 
I like to do some activities at open air, like surfing, skating, biking and trail;

My big next objective is to learn programming, because it's an important thing to know in those days and for me particularly it's a challenge, because I started and stoped it a lot of times;

For least I'm developing my spiritual side, so two times at week I go to a meet with some others spiritual partners to make a religious ceremony.
